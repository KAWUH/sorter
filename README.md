# Name: sorter
# Function: Sort a vector of structs by their numeric field
# Reason: I had to position a considerable group of people according to their height during an event, since I was learning Rust at the time I decided to make an app for it so that sorting would be done for me and I'd learn something along the way
# Current state: User can input data manually, load it from xml or txt file and sort in ascending order
# Future: Maybe I'll come back to this project once I learn more and either optimize it or make a whole new version with GUI, the latter will be located in a separate repository
